brightnessicon
==

Simple tray icon to adjust screen backlight. Depends on xbacklight, PyGObject
and GTK3, written in Python3.

This was inspired by a similar panel plugin from xfce's power manager, but
way simpler. The icon for the tray is also taken from [there](http://git.xfce.org/xfce/xfce4-power-manager/tree/).

A PGKBUILD for Arch Linux is provided in this repo and you can also find it in the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/brightnessicon-git/).
